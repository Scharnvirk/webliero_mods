## How to use the mods

This repo contains my mods for the game. 
To use a mod:
- download all its files (`.json5` and `.wlsprt` files) from relevant folder
- open chat (`enter` by default)
- type `/loadmod` and select both `mod.json5` (this contains "logic" changes of the mod) and `sprites.wlsprt` (this contains gfx changes of the mod)

Note, the `.json5` and `.wlsprt` files can be named any way you want, but in my mods they will be like above.
